# car-repair-shop
The owner of the workshop can control the work of himself and his employees by
posting information about the customer's car along with the car parts that were
replaced with it. The customer can track the repair of his car through a special
code generated by the service owner, who receives an SMS message to his
phone number. The workshop owner can add employees whose rights are
limited to managing the service due to their assigned role. The web application
provides invoice generation for customers.
